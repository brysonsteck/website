            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>My name is Bryson Steck. Nice to meet you!</p>

            <p>I am currently a Computer Science student in my junior year. I am also a developer of incredibly niche projects, of which range from Android applications and Minecraft Plugins. I am a huge Linux fanatic as well!</p>

            <p>On this website you can find relevant information about the projects I've worked on/continue to work on. This main page gives an overview of all these projects, but you can view more details about them by using the navigation bar at the top. This web server also acts as an updater for some of my projects.</p>

            <p>Resurrection is a Spigot Minecraft Server plugin that forces players to wait a certain amount of time before rejoining the world. This allows for tactical planning for games such as faction survival and other PvP gamemodes as it can severely penalize an entire team or faction if care is not taken.</p>
            <p>Resurrection can run on Spigot and Bukkit servers on Minecraft version 1.13 or later (currently). You can download the latest release of the plugin on the Spigot website <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/resurrection.94542/">here.</a> This project is also free and open source on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/brysonsteck/resurrection">here</a> under the AGPL-3.0 license.</p>
