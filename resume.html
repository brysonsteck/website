            <h2>Hello future viewer!</h2>

            <p>If you are here, it's probably because I put this link in a job application or wherever for you to look at how cool I am. This page provides links and information about certain things I have talent and/or experience in. This is a more friendly version of my <a href="https://github.com/brysonsteck/resume">GitHub</a> repository, since there are people in this world that don't understand Git or GitHub (yet).</p>

            <p>The sections below are categorized by category, whether the categories are certain topics, programming languages, etc. Please view any and all categories you wish, pertaining to what experience you are looking for or if you are just curious!</p>

            <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.brysonsteck.wiimmfiwatcher">Wiimmfi Watcher,</a> as mentioned earlier in the Java section, is an Android application programmed in Java that provides easy access to Mario Kart Wii online data on mobile through the Wiimmfi services.</p>

            <p>Since the Wiimmfi website isn't super mobile friendly, I decided to make my final project in school to be a mobile version of Wiimmfi using the website as an "API" of sorts. After I believed there was potential for this to grow, I later improved the app and posted it on the Google Play Store. This project is also open source on <a href="https://github.com/brysonsteck/wiimmfi-watcher">Github</a> under the GNU General Public License v3.0.</p>
