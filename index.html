            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>My name is Bryson Steck. Nice to meet you!</p>

            <p>I am currently a Computer Science student in my junior year. I am also a developer of incredibly niche projects, of which range from Android applications and Minecraft Plugins. I am a huge Linux fanatic as well!</p>

            <p>On this website you can find relevant information about the projects I've worked on/continue to work on. This main page gives an overview of all these projects, but you can view more details about them by using the navigation bar at the top. This web server also acts as an updater for some of my projects.</p>

            <h2>Resurrection</h2>
            <img class="resurrection-sc" src="resurrection-sc.png" alt="Resurrection Minecraft Screenshot">

            <p>Resurrection is a Spigot Minecraft Server plugin that forces players to wait a certain amount of time before rejoining the world. This allows for tactical planning for games such as faction survival and other PvP gamemodes as it can severely penalize an entire team or faction if care is not taken.</p>
            <p>Resurrection can run on Spigot and Bukkit servers on Minecraft version 1.13 or later (currently). You can download the latest release of the plugin on the Spigot website <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/resurrection.94542/">here.</a> This project is also free and open source on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/brysonsteck/resurrection">here</a> under the AGPL-3.0 license.</p>

                <p class="extra-padding">Wiimmfi Watcher is an unofficial Android app that displays online Mario Kart Wii room data by entering a friend code. <a href="https://wiimmfi.de">Wiimmfi</a> is a fan-made server that replaces the now defunct Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection ("Nintendo WFC" for short) and supports many popular Nintendo Wii and DS games, with the most popular being Mario Kart Wii. I am not offiliated with the Wiimmfi project nor it's developers.<br><br>
Originally a school project, I saw a use for it in the real world since the Wiimmfi website doesn't have a mobile friendly view. It is available on the Google Play Store <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.brysonsteck.wiimmfiwatcher">here</a>, with it's source code available on <a href="https://github.com/brysonsteck/wiimmfi-watcher">GitHub</a> under the GPL-3.0 license, for Android devices running KitKat 4.4 or newer.</p>
